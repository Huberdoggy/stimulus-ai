Stimulus.AI was created by [Kyle Huber](https://linkedin.com/in/kyle-james-my-filenames) in partnership with [Travis McBurney](https://linkedin.com/in/travis-mcburney). Together, the pair embarked a journey; designing a tool to serve as an ***adapter*** between AI-shaped job candidate insight and recruiter-shaped operational needs.

What you now have before you is the result of those endeavors.
Regardless of which end of the spectrum you fall, we hope that Stimulus.AI augments your existing processes with additional insights, enrichment, and efficiency.
